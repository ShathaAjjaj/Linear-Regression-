# Linear Regression

## 📖 Description

This project uses Linear Regression to predict housing prices in California based on features like income, age, and room number.

## 🧠 Model Explanation

Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to predict a value based on the relationship between variables.

It tries to find the best-fitting straight line through a set of data points.

🎯 When to Use Linear Regression

When your data has a linear relationship (i.e. as x increases, y increases/decreases at a consistent rate).

When you want to predict numbers (like price, age, temperature).

## ✅ Benefits

Simple and interpretable

Fast and efficient for regression problems

## ⚠️ Limitations

Poor performance with non-linear data

Sensitive to outliers and multicollinearity
